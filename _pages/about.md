I am a PhD student at the Fault Detection, Control, Optimization and Modeling Laboratory (D!FCOM) at UFMG since June 2025, working in Prof. Reinaldo Palhares' group. I completed my undergraduate studies in Control and Automation Engineering, graduating top of my class, with a focus on spacecraft attitude determination and control at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. In 2025, I obtained my MSc in Electrical Engineering from UFMG specializing in robust control. During my master's studies, I conducted research on data-driven static output-feedback control strategies for time-delay systems subject. My PhD research focuses on robust consensus protocols for nonlinear multi-agent systems, specifically distributed output-feedback protocols that are tolerant to a wide variety of network-induced phenomena.  In addition, I work on data-driven control techniques for attitude estimation and control of small satellites in collaboration with the [LODESTAR lab](https://lodestar.aerospace.unb.br).

I am interested in leveraging advances in robust control to develop more intelligent, secure, and efficient solutions for cyber-physical systems with limited communication and computational resources, as well as incomplete system information.
